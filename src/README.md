# Mergington High School Activities

A super simple website application that allows students to view and sign up for extracurricular activities.

## Features

- View all available extracurricular activities
- Sign up for activities
- Share activities with friends via social media, email, or direct link

## Social Sharing

Each activity card includes a "Share" button that allows users to easily share activities with their friends. When clicked, users can choose from multiple sharing options:

- **Email**: Share the activity via email
- **Copy Link**: Copy the activity link to clipboard for easy sharing
- **Facebook**: Share the activity on Facebook
- **Twitter**: Share the activity on Twitter

On mobile devices with native sharing support, the browser's built-in share dialog will be used instead, providing access to additional sharing options like messaging apps.
